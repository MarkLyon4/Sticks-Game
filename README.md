# Sticks-Game

This project is a game of sticks.  To play, you start with a certain number of sticks on the table.  You and the computer take turns picking up 1-3 sticks, causing the total number of sticks available for picking to dwindle.  You can choose how many sticks you pick up on a turn and the computer generally chooses randomly.  Whoever winds up with zero sticks left to pick on their turn loses.
